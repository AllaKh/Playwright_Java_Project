<h2>Booking fails with client‑side exception when dates are unavailable</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
  Attempting to access <code>/reservation/&lt;roomId&gt;</code> with a date range that is
  unavailable causes the entire application to throw a client‑side exception and render
  an error banner instead of a graceful “Room unavailable” message.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
  Instead of returning a user‑friendly notice, the SPA crashes and shows:<br>
  <em>“Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading automationintesting.online (see the browser console for more information).”</em><br>
  All page functionality is lost until the user manually navigates away.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open<br>
    <code>https://automationintesting.online/reservation/2?checkin=2020-01-01&amp;checkout=2020-01-02</code>
    (any obviously unavailable range will work).</li>
  <li>Observe the screen after the SPA finishes loading.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Actual Result:</strong><br>
  A full‑screen error banner appears; DevTools console shows an uncaught JavaScript
  exception. The booking UI does not load.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Result:</strong><br>
  User should receive a clear “No availability for selected dates” message and be able
  to choose different dates without the application crashing.</p>

<p><strong>Severity:</strong> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Critical</span><br>
  The bug blocks the primary booking flow and crashes the entire front‑end.</p>

<h2>Update and Delete pages are missing â€“ 404 Not Found</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
  The application does not have pages for <em>updating</em> or <em>deleting</em> bookings.
  Attempting to access these pages returns a 404 Not Found error.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
  When a user tries to navigate to the update or delete booking pages, the server responds
  with a 404 status code, indicating that these pages are not implemented or do not exist.
  As a result, users cannot modify or cancel existing reservations through the UI.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Reproduce (Update page):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new booking (which works and returns a confirmation).</li>
  <li>Attempt to access the update page (e.g., via URL or edit button).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Steps to Reproduce (Delete page):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new booking as admin.</li>
  <li>Attempt to access the update or delete page (e.g., via URL or update/delete button).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Actual Result (both pages):</strong><br>
  The server returns a 404 Not Found response, and the pages do not load.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Result:</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li><em>Update:</em> Booking details should be editable and saved successfully.</li>
  <li><em>Delete:</em> Bookings should be removable and the form reset without errors.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical<br>
  Without these pages, users cannot modify or cancel bookings, which can cause overbooking
  and increase support issues.</p>

<h2>Suite‑room code mismatch between Booking flow and Admin → Report</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
  When a guest books the Suite, the confirmation page shows room code
  <em>104</em>, yet the same reservation appears under room code
  <em>103</em> on the&nbsp;<code>Admin → Report</code> screen.  The
  discrepancy leads to reporting errors and possible overbooking.</p>

<p><strong>Steps&nbsp;to&nbsp;Reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <code>/reservation/3</code> (Suite) with any valid future
    check‑in and check‑out dates.</li>
  <li>Complete the two‑step booking form.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <strong>Observed:</strong> Confirmation banner states
    “Room: <strong>104</strong>”.</li>
  <li>Log in as admin (<em>admin&nbsp;/ password</em>) and open
    <code>Admin → Report</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Actual&nbsp;Result:</strong><br>
  The new entry is listed as “Room: <strong>103</strong>”.</p>

<p><strong>Expected&nbsp;Result:</strong><br>
  The room code in the report must match the code shown to the guest
  (104) and the physical allocation in the inventory system.</p>

<p><strong>Impact / Severity:</strong> <span style="color:red;"><b>Critical</b></span><br>
  Misreporting room numbers can cause double booking, housekeeping
  confusion, and revenue‑management inaccuracies.  The mismatch must
  be resolved before the Suite can be offered reliably.</p>
